description: Workflow for creating a new development branch.

1.  **Determine the Branch Type**:
    - Use `feature/` for new features.
    - Use `fix/` for bug fixes.
    - Use `docs/` for documentation changes.
2.  **Naming Convention**: Use `branch-type/issue-<number>-<short-description>` or just `branch-type/issue-<number>`.
3.  **Command**: Run `git checkout -b <branch-name>` to create and switch to the new branch.
