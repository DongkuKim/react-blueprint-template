description: Standard workflow for solving a GitHub issue by fetching details, branching, implementing, and creating a PR.
---

Follow these steps to solve a GitHub issue from start to finish:

1. **Fetch Issue Details**:
   - Use `mcp_github_get_issue` to retrieve the details of the issue.
   - Understand the requirements and context provided in the issue description.

2. **Create a Development Branch**:
   - Create a new git branch locally (or via GitHub) using a naming convention like `feature/issue-<number>` or `fix/issue-<number>`.
   - Command: `git checkout -b feature/issue-<number>`

3. **Solve the Issue**:
   - **Research**: If the solution isn't immediate, use `grep_search` or `find_by_name` to understand relevant parts of the codebase.
   - **Follow Guidelines**:
     - **Writing**: Use the `stop-slop` skill for all text/docs.
     - **React/Next.js**: Adhere to `vercel-composition-patterns` and `vercel-react-best-practices` skills.
     - **UI/UX**: Check against `web-design-guidelines` skill.
   - **Implement**: Write the necessary code or documentation to address the issue.
   - **Test**: Verify your changes by running existing tests and adding new ones where appropriate.
     - Command: `pnpm run test`
   - **Propose**: If the solution involves multiple complex steps, outline them for the user first.
   - **Commit**: Commit your changes with a clear message referencing the issue (e.g., `docs: add documentation (#<number>)`).

4. **Create a Pull Request**:
   - Push the branch to the remote repository.
   - Use `mcp_github_create_pull_request` to open a PR against the `main` branch.
   - Include "Resolves #<number>" in the PR body to automatically link the issue.

5. **Review and Comment**:
   - Use `mcp_github_add_issue_comment` to notify the user or stakeholders about the technical decisions made.
   - Use `mcp_github_create_pull_request_review` (as a comment or review) to self-verify the changes or summarize the implementation details.

6. **Update Related Issues**:
   - Check adjacent or dependent issues (e.g., next steps in the roadmap).
   - If the current changes impact them (e.g., API changes, new prerequisites), use `mcp_github_add_issue_comment` to update them with instructions or notes.
   - Example: "Update from Issue #X: The VAD module is now integrated, so ensuring timestamp alignment (Issue #Y) is critical."
